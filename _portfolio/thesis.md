title: "Application of a weighted Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) for Structure Comparison in
Radiation Treatment Planning"
excerpt: "My Honors College Thesis introduces a modified version of the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) for evaluating structural similarities within the context of radiation therapy planning. This modified DSC (mDSC) function, which was coded in R and integrated into the RadOnc R package, incorporates the radiation dose behavior at specific points, potentially offering a more clinically relevant structure comparison in radiation therapy compared to the traditional DSC.<br/><img src='/images/thesis.png'>"
