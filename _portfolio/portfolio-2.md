title: "Ethical Considerations in Using Generative AI Chatbots for High-Stakes Information Seeking Related to Substance Use and Addiction"
excerpt: "In this study, we examine the use of generative AI, like ChatGPT and LLaMA-2, in answering real-world questions related to substance use and recovery. While AI-generated responses were often rated as high quality by clinicians, we uncovered serious risks, such as incorrect medical advice and disinformation on critical topics like suicidal ideation and detox. The findings highlight the need for more safeguards before deploying AI in sensitive healthcare settings.<br/>"

### Abstract:
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, capable of an unprecedented ability to generate human-like text and converse in real time, hold potential for large-scale deployment in clinical settings such as substance use treatment. Treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs) is particularly high stakes, requiring evidence-based clinical treatment, mental health expertise, and peer support. Thus, promises of AI systems addressing deficient healthcare resources and structural bias are relevant within this domain, especially in an anonymous setting. This study explores the effectiveness of generative AI in answering real-world substance use and recovery questions. We collect questions from online recovery forums, use ChatGPT and Meta's LLaMA-2 for responses, and have SUD clinicians rate these AI responses. While clinicians rated the AI-generated responses as high quality, we discovered instances of dangerous disinformation, including disregard for suicidal ideation, incorrect emergency helplines, and endorsement of home detox. Moreover, the AI systems produced inconsistent advice depending on question phrasing. These findings indicate a risky mix of seemingly high-quality, accurate responses upon initial inspection that contain inaccurate and potentially deadly medical advice. Consequently, while generative AI shows promise, its real-world application in sensitive healthcare domains necessitates further safeguards and clinical validation.
