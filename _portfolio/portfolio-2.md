title: "Ethical Considerations in Using Generative AI Chatbots for High-Stakes Information Seeking Related to Substance Use and Addiction"
excerpt: "This project investigated the ethical implications of utilizing generative AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, in high-stakes, substance use-related contexts, focusing on their ability to deliver medical interventions. Through analyzing ChatGPT's responses to user-generated, high-risk questions from Reddit forums on substance use and recovery, the study assessed the appropriateness and quality of the chatbot's responses, as evaluated by a NIDA clinician. The results showed that while ChatGPT could generate generally appropriate and high-quality responses, the lack of transparency in its architecture and training, the potential for severe consequences from a single poor response, and the current content policy that prevents responses to high-risk substance use questions, raised substantial ethical concerns, leading to a non-endorsement of their usage in such critical scenarios.<br/><img src='/images/chatbot.png'>"
