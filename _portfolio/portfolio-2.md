title: "Smartphone Sensing and Digital Phenotyping for Prediction of Mood/Substance Use"
excerpt: "Developed an innovative software solution to process and clean data gathered through the AWARE framework from research participants, enabling seamless integration with the Reproducible Analysis Pipeline for Data Streams (RAPIDS) software given the needs of the lab. While the ultimate aim is to utilize smartphone sensor data to construct predictive models for mood and behaviors related to substance use, the current project stage focuses on assessing data sufficiency and other preliminary considerations.<br/>"
