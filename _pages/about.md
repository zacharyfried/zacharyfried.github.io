Welcome! I am currently a Linux Administrator at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and a Computer Science student at the University of Maryland. Although my educational background began with a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, my focus has shifted toward technology and software development.

As a Linux Administrator, I manage high-performance computing (HPC) servers supporting research in neuroimaging, natural language processing, and computational chemistry. While pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I am working to expand my skills with the goal of transitioning into the field of software engineering.

For more details, please explore my [projects](https://zacharyfried.github.io/portfolio) and [resume](https://zacharyfried.github.io/cv).
