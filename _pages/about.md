Welcome! Iâ€™m currently a Linux Administrator at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and a Computer Science student at the University of Maryland. While my educational background began with a BS in chemistry, my interests have shifted towards technology and software development.

In my role as a linux admin, I manage high-performance computing (HPC) servers used in neuroimaging, Natural Language Processing, and computational chemistry research. As I pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I am aiming to expand my skills to transition to the field of software engineering. 

For more details, please explore my [projects](https://zacharyfried.github.io/portfolio) and [resume/CV](https://zacharyfried.github.io/cv).
