Welcome! I'm currently a Postbaccalaureate Intramural Research Training Award (IRTA) Fellow working in the Technology and Translational Research Unit under the guidance of Dr. Brenda Curtis. While my educational background is in chemistry, my passion has evolved beyond the confines of the wet lab. I'm presently engaged in researching the risks of sexualized cannabis use, the revolutionary application of LLM chatbots in substance use recovery, and the potential of digital phenotyping for mood and substance use prediction. As the digital world continues to captivate my interest, I've embarked on a self-directed journey into programming. Driven by a genuine enthusiasm for technology, I am actively seeking opportunities to transition into a role in software engineering, where I can blend my analytical background with innovative solutions. For a deeper dive into my background and skills, please explore my [projects](https://zacharyfried.github.io/portfolio) and [resume/CV](https://zacharyfried.github.io/cv).
