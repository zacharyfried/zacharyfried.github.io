Welcome! I'm currently a Postbaccalaureate Intramural Research Training Award (IRTA) Fellow working in the Technology and Translational Research Unit under the guidance of Dr. Brenda Curtis. While my educational background is in chemistry, my passion has evolved beyond the confines of the wet lab. I'm presently engaged in researching the risks of sexualized cannabis use, the revolutionary application of LLM chatbots in substance use recovery, and the potential of digital phenotyping for mood and substance use prediction. My growing interest in human behavior has inspired a shift towards clinical psychology, and I am interested in opportunities that allow me to continue studying in fields related to mental health. For a deeper dive into my background and skills, please explore my [projects](https://zacharyfried.github.io/portfolio) and [resume/CV](https://zacharyfried.github.io/cv).
